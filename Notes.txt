-- Types and runtime
We need to monomorphize all functions.


-- To Do 7/1/2018

1) bind rec -> Different node, not just flag
    If one declaration in a declaration group -> Simple bind
    If multiple declarations in a group -> They're all bind recs
    :: Caveat
        unless they are *ALL* bindings to the same name, which will be desugared to a case statement as a single bind. 
        Example:
        foo Nothing = 0
        foo (Just x) = x

    however even one thing with a different name, then all of them are bind recs



2) Make nested functions work in core:
    example: Things that aren't simple assignment!
